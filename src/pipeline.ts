Find the significant developments across the whole defense-tech industry published since ${ctx.sinceDate}. Cover every sector below, not only the famous companies: contracts and awards, funding rounds, policy and budget moves, technology milestones, deals and IPOs, earnings, lessons from conflicts, allies' and adversaries' moves, and notable research reports.

Sectors:
${ctx.sectors}

Already on the desk (skip these unless there is material new information):
${ctx.knownUpdates}

Already on the upcoming-events calendar:
${ctx.upcoming}

Prefer primary sources (company, government and filing releases) and established outlets (Breaking Defense, DefenseScoop, Defense News, Reuters, Bloomberg, Air & Space Forces, USNI News, SpaceNews, think tanks). Use aggregator sites only when nothing better exists, and say so.

Write a research memo. For each development give: the date it happened, what happened, why it matters, which sectors it touches, the companies involved, and the exact source URL and publication name. Also list any newly announced dated upcoming events (deadlines, decisions, launches, reports due). Include only what you found sources for; if a sector had no real news, say so in one line rather than padding it.`;

Rules:
- updates: one entry per significant new development in the memo, with its exact source URL. Skip anything already on the desk (listed below). Sector ids must come from: ${SECTOR_IDS.join(", ")}.
- brief: the morning read. Three to five stories, most important first, chosen across the whole industry. Write for a smart non-expert: plain words, short sentences, very few numbers, no unexplained acronyms. "you" says why it matters to a founder looking for an edge or something to build. Each story's updateIndex points at the update it is based on.
- newCatalysts: only genuinely new dated upcoming events, not ones already on the calendar.
- Never invent facts, dates or URLs that are not in the memo.
